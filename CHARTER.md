6. Decision Making

7. Repository and Deliverable Development 


   6. Process 
The repository is designed to simplify and consolidate GitHub status tracking of work items managed by the Developer Experience Working Group. 


Proposed workflow


1. Idea:  Any Working Group member may submit a proposed idea as a candidate. This will be raised as an issue in Github. The Working Group will agree if they want to work on this.


2. Pre-Draft. If The Working Group decides to work on one of the ideas, a member will create a branch that points to the corresponding issue and uploads one or more documents (as text markdown files). Then the Working Group members work on the documents until a first draft is complete.


3. Draft. Once the documents are ready for review, a Pull Request is created, assigning at least two reviewers. 


4. Review. The Working Group members will review the documents and make any comments or suggestions. An iterative process starts with the interaction between reviewers and the draft’s editors.


5. Working Group Approval. Once every comment is solved and reviewers are happy with the documents, the PR is approved. Then the branch is ready to be merged into the master branch.

[a]Rotating leadership is great - The details are a bit premature I think... I don't know that every 2 months is possible. Perhaps, once a year?
