6. Decision Making 
Consensus/Voting/Approval. Each Working Group will endeavor to make all decisions by consensus. Where the Working Group cannot reach consensus with respect to a particular decision, the Developer Experience Working Group will make that decision by a supermajority vote of the Working Group Participants, as applicable.

7. Process 

7.1 The repository 
The is designed to simplify and consolidate GitHub status tracking of work items managed by the Developer Experience Working Group. 

The working group uses the GitHub workflow as it's primary mechanism for discussion and for decision making

Issues/Proposals can have the following statuses
- Issue - Identifies an issue which may have no clear solution - but can be identified as an area of research for the working group. (these can take the form of github issues with labels for priority)
- Draft - Seeks to solve a Discussion issue with a concrete proposal which is technologically feasible (if applicable). This may be a place where developers wishlist features of a proposed solution. (These will take the form of a pull request)
- Accepted - the proposal describes a sound solution to a statistically significant problem. A proposal is deemed Accepted when the working group agrees to merge a proposal into the main branch of the repository.
- Seeking Sponsorship/Action - The working group is actively soliciting sponsors or other actors to provide the solution described. Accepted proposals will either be accepted with an active sponsor, or the group will actively seek sponsorship for unsponsored, accepted proposals. A sponsor may include a large actor in the ecosystem or a small individual developer.

7.1 Scribe
A scribe is role is to be described;
A scribe for a meeting is assigned in the end of the previous meeting. The primary source for scribes is the chairs, if unavaliable a member of the group is selected by volunteering.
