# Developer-Experience-Working-Group

Welcome to the Cardano Developer Experience Working Group.

## What does the developer experience working group do?

We're a community-driven group dedicated to identifying and presenting potential solutions to developer experience problems that span the Cardano ecosystem. Once a potential solution is identified, we work with actors in the ecosystem to find sponsorship to implement a solution.

We meet every Tuesday at 3:30PM/15h30m UTC.

We also use Github for discussions and the IOHK Developer Discord.

## What kind of issues fall under developer experience?
- Key barriers to adopting or being productive when developing against Cardano, as either offchain statistics or onchain dApp
- Missing/Inadequate tooling or key workflow issues when composing tools to build an end-to-end dApp
- Documentation
- multi-language/multi-ecosystem tie-in (What are the added problems when building on Mobile, embedded systems, Unity/C#, Python or javascript ecosystems)
- Best practices and default dApp architectures.

## How can I get involved?

## How do we use this github repository?

This repository houses the [Charter](CHARTER.md), which defines how the group operates and makes decisions. We also have the [minutes](minutes) folder which houses text records of each Tuesday meeting, arranged by date.

Most discussion topics will take the form of Github issues and pull requests.
Issues describe a given problem facing the Cardano developer ecosystem, or a desired change to how the group is run.
PR's propose solutions, identify individuals or organizations which can and will execute the solution. Once a solution has a clear path to execution, the proposal will be merged to the main branch of the repository.

All merges require at least 1 review, merge rights are handled by the co-chairs.
