# Standardize HardFork Procedures
Developer Experience Working Group Proposal #X

v0.1

## Preamble

Developers urgently need to understand and repair issues arising from hardforks, to prevent community panic and reduce dApps breaking during the hardfork itself.

## Developer Experience Concerns
As seen in the Vasil hardfork, often backwards compatibility can be overestimated, resulting in a cascade of tooling and dApp updates becoming necessary.

Additionally, developers spend a tremendous amount of time trying to understand which tools and infrastructure work well with a given featureset.


## Proposed solution
It is critical that developers have clear messaging around the following:
- Testnet access
- which wallets support which testnets with which featureset
- testing period
- private-network simulation 
- hardfork timelines (such as multi-stage forks as seen in Vasil)
- feature breakdowns and usage examples 
- Creation of a registry where specific tools can self-report as HF compliant or HF complete once they have verified - including the dependency commits used to acheive it.
